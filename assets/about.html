                <p>Hi! My name is Cameron Sahagian-Crandall. I’m a senior in the Aerospace Engineering department at the University of Michigan. I have always had an interest in future-focused industries, and I enjoy working on challenging and exciting problems. Aerospace engineering is an embodiment of these interests to me, and it’s what I’m most passionate about.</p>
                <p>I’m currently Chief Engineer of the Michigan Aeronautical Science Association. MASA is a rocketry team at the University of Michigan that I have worked on for the last four years. Before that, I was Structures Lead. I first worked on our liquid bipropellant rocket called Tangerine Space Machine, which was designed to be the first amateur liquid rocket to reach space. Now, MASA is developing a new liquid bipropellant rocket called Clementine, which is designed to break the world altitude record for amateur liquid rockets.</p>
                <p>From January 2020 until July 2020, I worked a co-op at Northrop Grumman’s Launch Vehicles Division in Chandler, Arizona. I worked in their Dynamic Environments group, predicting vibration and shock in components and secondary structures and leading a test campaign to more accurately perform shock testing. Last summer I interned with Northrop Grumman’s Propulsion Systems in Promontory, Utah. I worked with the Loads and Environments team creating and analyzing FE models of motor cases and nozzles, defining vehicle requirements, and predicting self-induced static and dynamic motor loads.</p>
